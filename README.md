# Spotify-Analysis-of-My-Data
This is my first time gathering and creating my own dataset. This is also my first time performing data analysis, (I usually focus on Machine Learning). 

# How to Use
Do not run the get_id and get_features functions because it will take a long time. I have included my collected data in csv format. Just load it. 

If you want to gather your own data, you need to first create a developer Spotify account (it's free) and register an app. Copy the keys so you can get your token. Sometimes the token will expire, so just run the cell again in that case. 

get_id is usually correct but will occassionally grab the wrong song (read conclusion)
get_features is always correct
